                <p>I got to know Karen while I was on the board at Woodlands Market, and Karen's loyalty and length of employment with Woodlands Market speaks volumes. Her ability to multi-task and handle financial decisions is exceptional. Her business acumen and knowledge of accounting, along with her being trustworthy and loyal, are very hard to find in today's marketplace. As an independent grocer, most business consultants I encounter don't understand how many hats you have to wear but Karen knows it all too well, which for me is very important. Her professional experience in the many facets of business combined with the above skill set would make her a tremendous assest to any organization.
